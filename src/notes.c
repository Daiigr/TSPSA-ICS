Functions to implement:

Assignment 1:

- Function to fill the array of positions of cities, for a given value of n ≤ NMAX
- Fuction either randomly generates positions or takes from input.
- Function to compute the distances between them.

Assignment 2:

- Functions to initialize the path.
- Functions to perform the permutations listed 

Assignement 3:

- Function that computes the difference in energy ∆E = Ei − Etemp between configurations Ci
and Ctemp.
- Using this, and rand(), write a function that assigns Ctemp to Ci+1 with probability
P = e∆E/T for negative values of ∆E, and otherwise assigns Ci to Ci+1.

Assignement 4:

- Fully functioning program (main function) for simulated annealing using the functions developed in the
other assignments.
- Test this with different configurations of input, values of n and initial temperature T, etc. Note: It
is sufficient to declare just two paths: a current path and a candidate path. You then conditionally
overwrite the current path with the candidate in the annealing step.
